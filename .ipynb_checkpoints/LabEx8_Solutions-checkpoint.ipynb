    "Some infections, for example, those from the common cold and influenza, do not confer any long-lasting immunity upon recovery, and individuals become susceptible again. The SIS model can be used to study the behaviour of such infections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SIS model, there are only two compartments in a fixed population:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S(t)$ (susceptible) represents individuals of the population not yet infected with the disease at time $t$, or those susceptible in the population.\n",
    "- $I(t)$ (infectious) represents individuals of the population who have been infected with the disease and are capable of infecting others in the susceptible group. Once recovered, they are back to the susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"normalised\" SIS formulation consists of the following set of nonlinear differential equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dS'}{dt} = -rI'(R_{0}S'-1) $$ \n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI'}{dt} = rI'(R_{0}S'-1) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$r$ is the rate of recovery and $R_{0}$ is the basic reproductive number or ratio and is dependent on the parameter for infectivity ($R_{0} = \\frac{\\beta N}{r}$ where $N$ is the total population assumed to be a constant). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are to solve for the set of nonlinear differential equations in the SIS model and plot both the susceptible and infected populations on the same graph for $r = 1.0$ and $U0 = [1.0, 0.001]$. Create four plots with $R0$ taking on the following values:\n",
